# Loan Classifier For Banks - Customer will pay or not!
We have designed a loan classifier for banks that will extract a raw data from customers and predict if the person is going to payoff the loan or not. We have manaaged to build visually appealing way of understanding data as well as 5 different models for loan predicting system to get utilized according to the optimum need.

This dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. It includes following fields:

We did exploratory data analysis to find out the patterns regarding the information we have about the customers. Here is the sneak peak

We did preprocessing, one-hot encoding, train test spiliting and feature engineering before applying the following 5 models to generate a predicting system.
- K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

We have also applied the modeling results to the new data set Test.csv and compared the results of all the models through classification report. This is also called model evalution
